# AI/DEV Lab MCP Tools - Comprehensive Audit Report

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

The AI/DEV Lab is a comprehensive development environment designed to support the development, testing, and deployment of a **Customer Support AI Agent Demo Application**. The Lab provides a complete set of MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools that enable AI agents to manage the entire development lifecycle, from initial setup to production deployment.

**Core Purpose**: The entire Lab infrastructure exists to support the development and enhancement of the demo app located in the `app/` folder, which is a customer support AI agent system with A/B testing capabilities.

**Current Status**: **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED** - Cursor rules system showing persistent warnings despite proper configuration. System partially functional but requires immediate attention from audit agents.

### **2. Rule Configuration Status**
All three rules have been properly configured but warnings persist:

#### **enterprise_mode.mdc**
```yaml
---
description: "Comprehensive assistance mode with full capabilities for complex development tasks, background agents, and advanced MCP tool usage"
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: false
type: "Agent Requested"
---
```
**Status**: ‚úÖ Properly configured but showing warnings

#### **free_mode.mdc**
```yaml
---
description: "Efficient mode for concise interactions with limited resource usage, optimized for quick tasks and minimal context"
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: false
type: "Agent Requested"
