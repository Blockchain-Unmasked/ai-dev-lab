# Sandbox Directory

This directory is reserved for development, testing, and experimentation activities.

## Purpose

- **Development**: Test new features and configurations
- **Experimentation**: Try different approaches and solutions
- **Testing**: Validate functionality before production use
- **Prototyping**: Create proof-of-concept implementations

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Keep it isolated**: Sandbox work should not affect production files
2. **Document experiments**: Record what you're testing and why
3. **Clean up regularly**: Remove completed experiments and tests
4. **Follow security**: Respect Guardian policies even in sandbox

## Current Status

- **Status**: Ready for development activities
- **Security**: Guardian policies apply
- **Approval**: Standard approval gates active

## Next Steps

1. Begin development work as needed
2. Document experiments and findings
3. Move successful implementations to appropriate locations
4. Maintain clean, organized workspace
