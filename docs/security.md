## Security Posture

### Current Status: **Bootstrap Phase**
- Local-only operations
- No external network access
- Guardian MCP server active
- Approval gates configured

### Risk Assessment

#### Low Risk
- Local file operations within project bounds
- Cursor IDE integration
- MCP tool usage with Guardian oversight

#### Medium Risk
- Background agent execution (requires approval)
- File operations outside project root (requires approval)
- Long-running computations (requires approval)

#### High Risk
- System-level operations (blocked)
- Network access (restricted)
- Credential exposure (forbidden paths)

## Guardian MCP Server

### Security Policies
- **Mode**: Strict with approval requirements
- **Scope**: Project root confinement
- **Logging**: Complete audit trail
- **Compliance**: Security policy enforcement

### Approval Workflow
1. **Request**: User initiates restricted operation
2. **Validation**: Guardian checks policy compliance
3. **Approval**: User confirms operation
4. **Execution**: Operation proceeds with logging
5. **Audit**: Complete trail recorded

## Compliance Requirements

### Local Development
- No external API calls during bootstrap
- All operations logged and auditable
- Security policies enforced at MCP level
- User approval required for sensitive operations

### Future Considerations
- Team collaboration security
- Cloud integration security review
- Automated security scanning
- Compliance reporting

## Incident Response

### Security Events
1. **Detection**: Guardian logging and monitoring
2. **Assessment**: Policy violation analysis
3. **Response**: Immediate operation blocking
4. **Investigation**: Audit trail analysis
5. **Remediation**: Policy updates and user notification

### Contact Information
- **Security Lead**: Project owner
- **Incident Response**: Guardian MCP server
