# AI/DEV Lab Project Instructions

## üéØ **Project Overview**
This is the AI/DEV Lab project - a comprehensive development environment with MCP server integration, mission systems, and multiple operational modes.

## üöÄ **Enterprise Mode (Full Capabilities)**
When operating in **Enterprise Mode**, provide comprehensive, thorough assistance with:
- **Full MCP Integration**: Access to all server tools and resources
- **Background Processing**: Orchestrate long-running operations  
- **Advanced Analysis**: Deep code and system analysis
- **Team Features**: Multi-user collaboration and management
- **Security Hardening**: Advanced security features and monitoring

**Use Enterprise Mode for:**
- Complex architectural decisions and reviews
- Large-scale refactoring and optimization
- Background agent operations and monitoring
- Comprehensive security reviews and audits
- Team collaboration and knowledge management
- Performance optimization and scalability planning

## üéØ **Free Mode (Efficient & Focused)**
When operating in **Free Mode**, provide concise, efficient assistance with:
- **Efficiency First**: Keep responses concise and focused
- **Limited Tool Usage**: Use only essential operations
- **Smart File References**: Use `@file` references instead of long pastes

**Use Free Mode for:**
- Quick questions and clarifications
- Simple file edits and modifications
- Basic code reviews and suggestions
- Documentation updates
- Simple configuration changes

**Avoid in Free Mode:**
- Complex architectural decisions
- Large-scale refactoring
- Background agent operations
- Resource-intensive analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è **MCP Server Usage Guidelines**

### **CRITICAL: Server Type Separation**
- **Lab MCP Servers**: For overall lab development and Cursor chat operations
- **App MCP Servers**: For use within the app only, NOT for lab development

### **Lab MCP Servers (Cursor Chat & Lab Development)**
**Use for:**
- Repository-wide file operations and management
- System-level development tasks
- Installing packages and dependencies
- Running terminal commands for lab development
- Managing other MCP servers
- Web scraping and analysis for lab projects
- Mission system operations and coordination
- Cross-project development tasks
- Infrastructure management and setup

### **App MCP Servers (App-Only Usage)**
**Use for:**
- App-specific data operations
- App user management
- App-specific analytics and metrics
- App content management
- App configuration changes
- App testing and validation

**NEVER use App MCP Servers for:**
- Lab development tasks
- System-level operations
- Repository-wide changes
- Terminal command execution
- Package installation

## üìÅ **Project Structure**
- **Root**: Overall project management and lab development
- **app/**: Application-specific code and operations
- **mcp-servers/**: MCP server configurations and management
- **missions/**: Mission system files and coordination
- **docs/**: Project documentation and architecture

## üîí **Security & Compliance**
- Enforce comprehensive security policies
- Require explicit approval for sensitive operations
- Maintain complete audit trails and compliance
- Never expose sensitive information or credentials

## üí° **Best Practices**
1. **Choose the right mode** for the task complexity
2. **Use appropriate MCP servers** for the scope of work
3. **Reference files with @filename** instead of pasting content
4. **Document changes** immediately
5. **Verify operations** before proceeding
6. **Maintain security** in all operations
