AI/DEV Research — Project Structure & Plan Start Date: August 21, 2025 — 2:22 AM EST\ Phase: Research & Prep (Web‑based ChatGPT Session) 
 Core Mission 
This project explores how to use AI agents, MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, and agent-driven development in a structured environment. Since we are not building local folders yet, all planning, documentation, and research will be conducted within this ChatGPT project folder (canvas). The end goal is to prepare a foundation that can later run inside Cursor IDE with clear separation of sandboxing, MCP setup, and references. 
Key goals: 
•  
Keep the setup independent and unbiased. 
•  
Provide a clear research blueprint before local setup. 
•  
Document findings and decisions in this project folder (web-based). •  
Prepare for both minimal/free Cursor usage and full premium/enterprise usage. •  
Map Cursor’s features, costs, and capabilities into an X–Y feature grid. •  
Incorporate MCP security best practices. 
 Virtual Folder Structure (for planning only) 
Even though we are not creating local folders yet, this structure acts as the conceptual map: 
•  
sandbox/ → Independent experimentation (agents, tests, notes). •  
mcp-server/ → MCP schemas, endpoints, configs, docs. •  
references/ → Read-only repositories and docs. 
•  
meta/ → Research notes, prompts, roadmap, decision logs, feature grid. •  
docs/ → Setup, architecture, findings, cursor notes, security checklist. •  
scripts/ → Future automation helpers. 
This lives here in ChatGPT project canvas until we migrate to a real repo. 
 Cursor IDE Integration 
•  
Cursor can eventually consume this plan once local folders are created. 
•  
Research must account for two scenarios: 
•  
Free/Pro: Only chat features, manual MCP setup. 
•  
Premium/Enterprise: Background Agents, Bugbot, Memories, Jupyter, one‑click MCP. 1
•  
.cursor/rules and workspace hygiene best practices will be documented here first. 
 Feature Grid Analysis (X–Y) 
X-axis → Cost (Free → Paid/Enterprise).\ Y-axis → Capability (Basic → Advanced). Quadrants: 
1.  
Low Cost / Low Capability → Free tier basics. 
2.  
High Cost / Low Capability → Paid, minimal usage. 
3.  
Low Cost / High Capability → Maximized free features, workarounds. 4.  
High Cost / High Capability → Premium/enterprise, full feature set. 
Current Feature Mapping (Aug 21, 2025): 
•  
Free Tier → Chat, code edits, .cursor/rules , manual MCP. •  
Pro Tier → Faster response, larger contexts. 
•  
Premium → Background Agent, Bugbot, Memories, Jupyter, one‑click MCP. •  
Enterprise → Multi‑seat, org‑wide, deep integrations. 
This mapping will guide our dual-mode planning. 
 MCP Security Strategy 
•  
Track vulnerabilities: prompt injection, tool poisoning, unauthorized access. •  
Integrate MCPSafetyScanner (academic scanning tool). 
•  
Use MCP Guardian for auth, rate-limiting, and WAF protection. •  
Reference MCPLIB threat taxonomy for systematic analysis. •  
Document mitigations here in docs/security.md (conceptually). 
 Additions Beyond Initial Idea 
•  
Meta folder for prompts, decision logs, research. •  
Docs for setup, architecture, cursor notes, security. •  
Scripts for automation. 
•  
Feature Grid to align Cursor features vs. budget. •  
Dual Mode Plan for free vs. premium. •  
Security hardening (Scanner, Guardian, Taxonomy). 2
 Next Steps (Web-based Research Session) 
1.  
Use this canvas to log meta/research-notes directly in chat. 2.  
Draft first feature grid table here in canvas. 
3.  
Capture best practices from Cursor updates, Reddit, and MCP docs. 4.  
Create dual‑path super prompt templates in chat (Free vs Premium modes). 5.  
Summarize MCP schema stubs (concept only, no code yet). 
6.  
Build first Cursor audit prompt to validate when local setup begins. 
7.  
Export this plan as PDF so it can be attached into a fresh ChatGPT session as the research 
foundation. 
Research Session Prep:\ We are now ready to run a fresh ChatGPT research session within this project folder (canvas). No local folders yet — everything will be documented here until we migrate. The session will: 
•  
Validate the conceptual structure against MCP spec. 
•  
Draft X–Y feature grid in detail. •  
Compare Cursor workflows (Free vs Premium). 
•  
Begin documenting security guardrails. •  
Output dual-path super prompts for Cursor IDE. 
 Prompt for Fresh ChatGPT Research Session 
Instruction:\ "Start a new ChatGPT session. Import the AI/DEV Research — Project Structure & Plan document in PDF form. Treat it as the core reference for this research project. Continue research by: 
1.  
Validating MCP structure against official documentation. 
2.  
Expanding the feature grid with detail and use-cases. 3.  
Capturing latest Cursor IDE best practices and mapping them. 
4.  
Proposing dual-path prompt templates (Free vs Premium modes). 
5.  
Documenting security strategies with MCP Guardian, SafetyScanner, and MCPLIB taxonomy. 6.  
Iterating all findings back into the research plan systematically." 3
