# Input Directory

This directory is designated for research PDF files that will be processed and analyzed.

## Purpose

- **PDF Storage**: Centralized location for research documents
- **Intake Processing**: Prepare documents for analysis
- **Workflow Management**: Track document processing status
- **Security**: Isolate input files from production code

## PDF Intake Process

### 1. File Placement
- Place research PDFs directly in this directory
- Use descriptive filenames for easy identification
- Ensure PDFs are readable and accessible

### 2. Intake Tracking
- Check `meta/decisions.md` for intake logging
- Record filename, timestamp, and processing status
- Update tracking as documents are processed

### 3. Processing Workflow
- Use Cursor with appropriate mode (free/enterprise)
- Extract key insights and requirements
- Generate summaries and recommendations
- Update project documentation with findings

## File Guidelines

### Supported Formats
- **Primary**: PDF files (*.pdf)
- **Future**: May support additional document formats

### Naming Convention
- Use descriptive, meaningful filenames
- Include date or version if relevant
- Avoid special characters and spaces

### Organization
- Keep files organized by topic or source
- Consider subdirectories for large collections
- Maintain clear separation from processed outputs

## Security Considerations

- **Isolation**: Input files are separate from production code
- **Access Control**: Guardian policies apply to file operations
- **Audit Trail**: All file operations are logged
- **Cleanup**: Remove processed files when no longer needed

## Current Status

- **Status**: Ready for PDF placement
- **Files**: None placed yet
- **Next Step**: Add research PDFs for processing

## Next Steps

1. **Place PDFs**: Add research documents to this directory
2. **Update Tracking**: Record intake in meta/decisions.md
3. **Begin Processing**: Use Cursor to analyze documents
4. **Generate Outputs**: Create PRD, plans, and tasks

## Example Workflow

```
1. Place research.pdf in input/
2. Update meta/decisions.md with intake record
3. Use Cursor to analyze document content
4. Extract key insights and requirements
5. Update docs/architecture.md with findings
6. Generate actionable tasks in meta/feature_grid.md
7. Mark PDF as processed in tracking
```
