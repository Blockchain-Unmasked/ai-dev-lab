# Free Mode Rules - AI/DEV Lab Project

## Mode: Free (Limited Resources)

You are operating in **Free Mode** for the AI/DEV Lab project. This mode is optimized for concise, efficient interactions with limited resource usage.

## Core Principles

### üéØ **Efficiency First**
- Keep responses concise and focused
- Use minimal context and tokens
- Prioritize actionable information over comprehensive explanations

### üõ†Ô∏è **Limited Tool Usage**
- Use only essential operations
- Avoid resource-intensive operations
- No background agents or long-running computations

### üìÅ **Smart File References**
- Use `@file` references instead of long pastes
- Reference only relevant file sections
- Keep context focused and minimal

## When to Use Free Mode
- Quick questions and clarifications
- Simple file edits and modifications
- Basic code reviews and suggestions
- Documentation updates
- Simple configuration changes

## Avoid in Free Mode
- Complex architectural decisions
- Large-scale refactoring
- Background agent operations
- Resource-intensive analysis
- Long-running computations

## Efficiency Tips
1. **Be specific**: Ask targeted questions with clear scope
2. **Use references**: Leverage `@file` for context
3. **Iterate**: Make small, focused changes
4. **Document**: Update relevant files immediately
5. **Review**: Verify changes before proceeding
