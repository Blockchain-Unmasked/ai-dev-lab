# Test Auto Attached Rule - AI/DEV Lab Project

## ðŸŽ¯ **Auto Attached Rule Test**

This rule demonstrates the **Auto Attached** functionality in Cursor. It will automatically apply when working with files in the `app/` directory.

## When This Rule Applies

This rule automatically activates when you:
- Open any file in the `app/` directory
- Work with Python files in `app/`
- Work with JavaScript files in `app/`
- Access any subdirectory within `app/`

## Purpose

This is a demonstration rule to show how **Auto Attached** rules work differently from:
- **Always** rules (like `mcp_server_usage.mdc`)
- **Agent Requested** rules (like `enterprise_mode.mdc` and `free_mode.mdc`)

## Test Instructions

1. Open any file in the `app/` directory
2. This rule should automatically appear in your context
3. Check **Project â†’ Rules** to see it marked as "Auto Attached"
