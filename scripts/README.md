# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility scripts for project automation and maintenance.

## Purpose

- **Automation**: Streamline repetitive tasks and workflows
- **Maintenance**: Keep project files organized and up-to-date
- **Utilities**: Provide helpful tools for development and analysis
- **Integration**: Support MCP server and Cursor workflows

## Current Scripts

- **None yet**: Scripts will be added as needed

## Script Guidelines

1. **Security first**: All scripts must respect Guardian policies
2. **Documentation**: Each script should have clear usage instructions
3. **Error handling**: Include proper error handling and validation
4. **Testing**: Test scripts in sandbox before production use

## Security Considerations

- **Path validation**: Scripts must respect project root confinement
- **Approval gates**: Sensitive operations require user approval
- **Audit logging**: All script executions are logged
- **Policy compliance**: Follow established security guidelines

## Future Scripts

Potential scripts to consider:
- PDF processing automation
- Security policy validation
- Documentation generation
- Backup and restore utilities
- Integration testing helpers

## Next Steps

1. Identify automation needs
2. Design and implement utility scripts
3. Test thoroughly in sandbox
4. Document usage and security considerations
